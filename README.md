# discord.py-example.py
Instabot-py GitHub repo:
https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py
original example.py link:
https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py/blob/master/example.py
Since 5th August 2019, if you now go to the original example.py file then it shows the following code:
#!/usr/bin/env python3# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-"""The example.py is deprecated. Please use the declarative mode with YAML settingsPlease refer to Github README + (instabot -h) + Blog section for further information"""print(__doc__)

You need not to worry because the previous code should still work which you can copy-paste from this repo.
