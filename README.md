Since 5th August 2019, if you now go to the original example.py file then it shows the following code:
<code>#!/usr/bin/env python3# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-"""The example.py is deprecated. Please use the declarative mode with YAML settingsPlease refer to Github README + (instabot -h) + Blog section for further information"""print(__doc__)</code>

You need not to worry because the previous code should still work for version 0.4.1 or below which you can copy-paste from this repo.
<Strong>Latest versions of instabot-py that are being released recently since August 2019 (version 0.5+) are incompatible with this code and it only works for version 0.4.10 or below. Looks like I would need to research and make a new tutorial again for August 2019 onwards. Things get outdated pretty quickly these days. :/</Strong>
